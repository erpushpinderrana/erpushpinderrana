I am Pushpinder, a Drupal architect, coder, and self-proclaimed developer who specializes in backend development. I love working in Drupal.
Currently, working in various roles such as a Full Stack Developer, Drupal Architect, and Technical Lead on various projects.

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Pushpinder, a seasoned Web Developer with over 20 years of experience in crafting robust and innovative web solutions. I'm passionate about building user-friendly interfaces and scalable backend systems that drive business growth.

ðŸ’¼ Currently, I work as a Technology Manager at Appnovation, where I lead a team of developers in creating cutting-edge web applications. Prior to this, I've held various roles in both startups and established companies, honing my skills across the full stack.

ðŸš€ My expertise lies in CMS, Drupal, Contentful, DevOps (including Cloud Services like AWS and GCP), as well as backend technologies such as Node.js, Python, and PHP. I'm proficient in Web Development and I'm well-versed in open source CMS like Wordpress.
